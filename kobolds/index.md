# Kobolds

## Foreword

I have never, I'm pretty sure, read any official write-up of what a kobold is.
Everything I know about kobolds is apocryphal and from various conflicting
sources. That is, as far as I'm concerned, as it should be. I don't put much
stock in official sources, anyway, because they mostly talk about how kobolds
are inherently evil, which is garbage.

Also, much of this originated in a migraine-fueled bout of insomnia after
reading someone's long thread about their new kobold roleplaying character idea
online. I don't know if you'll be able to tell or not.

So here is a bunch of ideas I have about kobolds. Some of this will be familiar
and some of it may be wildly new and I probably won't know which is which for
any given reader. I hope you like it.


## Sections

As I've worked on this, it became harder to organize in a single document, so
it's been broken up into topical sections.

1. [Biology](./biology.md) – A description of what kobolds look like, how their
   bodies work and related topics.
1. [Sociology](./sociology.md) – A discussion of common patterns and practices
   in kobold culture and society.
1. [Relations with Non-Kobold Cultures](./non-kobolds.md) – A look into how kobolds
   relate to non-kobolds in the world around them.
